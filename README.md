## Project Plan

### Purpose
* What is the goal of this project? What question(s) is this research answering?

The goal of this project is to verify and try to recreate the research carried out by Zhang et al. BMC Genomics in the paper *RNA-seq and Tn-seq reveal fitness determinants of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during growth in human serum* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29162049.

The questions that this research aims to answer are:
1. Which genes contribute to the growth of E. faecium in human serum?

2. What genes may serve as targets for the development of novel anti-infectives for the treatment of E. faecium bloodstream infections?
